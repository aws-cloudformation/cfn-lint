### Roadmap
- Be able to test transforms (include)
- Add tests around common resource types
  - AutoScaling
  - Ec2 Instances
  - Load Balancers
  - RDS
- Create a framework to test ARNs
- Test Ref resources to IAM Roles have good assume role documents.  Example: Lambda Function Ref refers to an IAM Role that can be assume by Lambda.
- More Warnings around hard coded values (Regions, AccountIds) to help with the practice of reusability

### 0.2.1
###### Features
- Added AllowedValues for Cidr parameter checking Rule W2509

###### Fixes
- Fixed an issue with Rule E1019 not giving errors when there was a bad pseudo parameter
- Fixed an issue where conditions with Refs were validated as strings instead of Refs
