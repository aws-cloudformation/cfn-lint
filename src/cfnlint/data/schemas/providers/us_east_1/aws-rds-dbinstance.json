The list can include both the physical IDs of existing VPC security groups and references to [AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html) resources created in the template.\n If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC.\n  If you set ``VPCSecurityGroups``, you must not set [DBSecurityGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups), and vice versa.\n  You can migrate a DB instance in your stack from an RDS DB security group to a VPC security group, but keep the following in mind:\n  +  You can't revert to using an RDS security group after you establish a VPC security group membership.\n  +  When you migrate your DB instance to VPC security groups, if your stack update rolls back because the DB instanc",
