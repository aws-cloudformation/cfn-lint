        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report! Try to include as much information as you can.

        For reference, the current version of cfn-lint is <img src="https://badge.fury.io/py/cfn-lint.svg" />.

        Cfn-lint uses the [CloudFormation resource provider schemas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-type-schemas.html) as the base to do validation. These files are included as part of the application version. Please update to the latest version of `cfn-lint` or update the spec files manually (`cfn-lint -u`)
