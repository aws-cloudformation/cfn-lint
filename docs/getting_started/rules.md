# Creating Rules
This guide describes how to create a new rule to be used by `cfn-lint`.

## Introduction to rules

An overview of all the rules that are currently supported can be found [**here**](../rules.md).

A rule is a standalone Python class inherited from the base rule: `CloudFormationLintRule` that checks the given CloudFormation template for invalid JSON/YAML syntax, deployment errors, best practices, unused resources and other possible issues in the template.

Besides the rules from `cfn-lint` itself, it can also process external rules by using the `-a/--append-rules` argument, making it possible to integrate custom rulesets.

### Rules of the rules

When creating a rule for `cfn-lint`, keep the following rules in mind:

* A rule has to be applicable to *ALL* users of the toolkit by default. If a rule contains specific business logic, create a custom rule.
* A rule typically covers a single specific use case. It's not an exact science, but create multiple rules if you think it's needed.
* A rule is an `Error` (blocking) or `Warning` (not blocking). Create multiple specific rules if a rule can be both.
* A rule should focus on its own requirements. Missing a required property? That's handled by an [existing rule](./rules.md#E3003) already.

These rules don't apply to custom rules sets, you're free to build your own rules.

### Rule Matches
A rule returns its findings by returning a list of `RuleMatch` objects. A `RuleMatch` is an object containing information about the finding:

* Path to the resource. Used for returning line/column information of the finding in the file.
* The message about the finding. This is a specific error message that can be formatted to contain detailed information about the error (it's not the Rule's description).

See the [code snippets](#code_snippets) section for an example on how to [add a finding](#add_a_ruleMatch) .

## Creating a new rule
The following steps describe the basics on how to create a new rule.

*As an example we use `MyNewRule` as the rule to be added.*

### Select a new Rule ID
Go to the [rules documentation](./rules.md) and find an appropriate available Rule ID, based on the correct [category](./rules.md#categories).

### Create new Rule
Based on the use case and [rule category](./rules.md#categories), create a new Python file in the correct namespace of the [rules folder](/src/cfnlint/rules). Use the name of the Rule, so the filename of `MyNewRule` is `mynewrule.py`.

Use the following skeleton code as a starting point of your new rule:

```python
"""

"""
from cfnlint.rules import CloudFormationLintRule
from cfnlint.rules import RuleMatch


class MyNewRule(CloudFormationLintRule):
    """Rule description """
    id = '' # New Rule ID
    shortdesc = '' # A short description about the rule
    description = '' # (Longer) description about the rule
    source_url = '' # A url to the source of the rule, e.g. documentation, AWS Blog posts etc
    tags = [] # A set of tags (strings) for searching

    def match(self, cfn):
        """Basic Rule Matching"""

        matches = []

        # Your Rule code goes here

        return matches
```
Fill in the metadata (`id`, `shortdesc`, `description`, `source_url`, `tags`) of your new rule, these are required attributes needed for processing the rule.

Since `cfn-lint` loads all rules from the `rules` folder as a plugin, the file and Class name must be the same.

*At this point your new rule is already part of the linter's ruleset!*

See the [code snippets](#code_snippets) section below for some examples of an implemention.

### Test your new Rule
You can test your new rule by just running `cfn-lint`, but preferably your new rule is validated by unit tests.

#### Fixtures
Fixture templates are created under the [test/templates/good](/test/templates/good) (for templates with valid CloudFormation code) or [test/templates/bad](/test/templates/bad) (for template with invalid CloudFormation code) folders.  
Use `YAML` for the CloudFormation templates for readability and the ability to add comments in the template

#### Test class
Create a `test_mynewrule.py` at the appropriate location in the [`test/rules/`](/test/rules) folder.

Use the following skeleton code as a starting point of your new rule:

```python
"""
Copyright Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates. All Rights Reserved.
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT-0
"""
from cfnlint.rules.MyNewRule import MyNewRule  # pylint: disable=E0401
from .. import BaseRuleTestCase


class TestMyNewRule(BaseRuleTestCase):
    """Test template parameter configurations"""
    def setUp(self):
        """Setup"""
        super(TestMyNewRule, self).setUp()
        self.collection.register(MyNewRule())

    def test_file_positive(self):
        """Test Positive"""
        self.helper_file_positive() # By default, a set of "correct" templates are checked

    def test_file_negative(self):
        """Test failure"""
        self.helper_file_negative('test/fixtures/templates/bad/mynewrule.yaml', 1) # Amount of expected matches
```

As you can see `test_file_negative()` in this unit test makes specific use of a CloudFormation template from the Fixtures folder. It's important to provide examples of templates which pass your new rule, and also templates which generate the expected warning/error.

#### Running the Tests

Please see detailed instructions [here](/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Code Snippets
The skeleton code mentioned in the [Create new Rule](#create_new_rule) step contains no real code to keep it as simple as possible.

This section contains a few simple and straightforward snippets to get you started. For more complex solutions, take a deep-dive in the code of the [existing rules](/src/cfnlint/rules)!

### Add a RuleMatch
The following snippet is a simple example on how to return a finding for every resource in the template:

```python
# Get all resources
resources = cfn.get_resources()

matches = []
# Loop over all the found resources
for resource_name, resource in resources.items():
    # The path is used to determine the line/column number when returning the Match information.
    path = ['Resources', resource_name]
    # The error message with specific error information
    message = 'An error message about resource {0}'
    matches.append(RuleMatch(path, message.format(resource_name)))

return matches
```

### Check specific resource types
The following snippet is a simple example on checking a specific resource type:

```python
# Get all EC2 instances from the template
resources = cfn.get_resources(['AWS::EC2::Instance'])

matches = []
# Loop over all the found resources
for resource_name, resource in resources.items():
    # Check the InstanceType setting
    properties = resource.get('Properties')

    # Only check what we need. Other rules handle misconfigurations
    if properties:
        # Check the instance type specified
        if properties.get('InstanceType') == 't2.small':

          # The path is used to determine the line/column number when returning the Match information.
          path = ['Resources', resource_name, 'Properties', 'InstanceType']
          message = 'Please do not use t2.small'
          matches.append(RuleMatch(path, message.format(resource_name)))

return matches
```

### Check property values
The following snippet is a simple example on checking specific property values:

```python
def check_value(self, value, path):
    """Check SecurityGroup descriptions"""
    matches = []

    # Check max length
    if len(value) > 255:
        message = 'GroupDescription length ({0}) exceeds the limit (255) at {1}'
        full_path = '/'.join(str(x) for x in path)
        matches.append(RuleMatch(path, message.format(len(value), full_path)))

    return matches

def match(self, cfn):
    """Check SecurityGroup descriptions"""

    resources = cfn.get_resources(['AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup'])
    matches = []
    for resource_name, resource in resources.items():
        path = ['Resources', resource_name, 'Properties']

        properties = resource.get('Properties')
        if properties:
            matches.extend(
                cfn.check_value(
                    properties, 'GroupDescription', path,
                    check_value=self.check_value
                )
            )

    return matches
```
The `check_value` method in the `Template` class is a helper function to check values in a quick and simple way. It supports the handling of multiple values:

```python
def check_value(self, obj, key, path,
                check_value=None, check_ref=None,
                check_find_in_map=None, check_split=None, check_join=None,
                check_import_value=None, check_sub=None,
                **kwargs):
...
```
